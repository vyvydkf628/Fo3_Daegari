# Deok Chain : Mania's playground through the Block Chain 
## Introduction

Most of us have more than one hobby.
The Duck Chain provides playgrounds for various enthusiasts through the block chain.

## What's difference from traditional internet community.

1. You can leave the data on the blockchain that we want to keep permanently with our archive.
2. Non-Fungible Token (NFT) can be used to clarify ownership of tickets, goods, etc.
3. Transaction capabilities enable you to move beyond time and space and transparent cloud funding without intervention by an intermediary administrator.
4. Smart contracts allow you to develop extended content at any time.

## Why we use Block Chain?
Blockchain features security, transparency, decentralization, scalability, and reliability. Traditional community services have the following challenges.
1. **Ownership dispute over goods, tickets, etc. : Security**   
Fake issues such as limited-edition products and famous concert tickets have been tried in various ways, but they still remain problems. In fact, according to the New York Times, about five times a week there is a "fake ticket" problem on Broadway, especially in a "hot" musical where tickets are hard to buy. These problems are addressed using NFT(Non-Fungible Token). Blockchain technology shows and shares transaction details to all users, making it difficult to fabricate or falsify. The combination of these characteristics makes it possible to prevent ticket-related fraud or crime.
